# 🫀 Heart Disease Detection Using Supervised Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health-related features. The dataset includes key attributes such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease history, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes. These factors are commonly associated with cardiovascular health and play a critical role in risk prediction.

The model is designed to assist healthcare professionals by providing a data-driven prediction tool that can help identify individuals at high risk of heart disease, enabling early interventions. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalise numerical features, and encode categorical variables. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, and Random Forest have been explored and evaluated based on their accuracy, recall, ROC score and precision.

The goal is to create an accessible, effective, and efficient tool that can assist in the early detection of heart disease, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in health risk prediction and can be extended to real-world applications such as diagnostic tools and personalised healthcare planning.
